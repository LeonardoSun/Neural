level one store the data.
maybe connect those data.
level two clustering the data of level one.
level three and four store the connection between abstracted data and those clustered data.
the abstract operation is processed by other parts.
this process maybe handled by the consciousness, when it is a complex operation,
or the default abstractor didn't worked out fine.
use vision as an example:
when we see things, and try to remember. we remember the color block first.
and then the shape, the detail, etc.
every process will cause a association.
we continuously make the shape more accurate, and add more details.
we don't find all the details and accurate shapes, because
generally, the input (vision) is not stable.
so the sequence is very important to us.
we use the sequence to count and analyze the input.
we human is vision creature and (time/space) sequence creature.
this is the memory model.

abstractor:
high level abstract is executed by the consciousness.
low level abstract is related to cortex level structure.
low level cortex generates patterns,
simply connect patterns,  which called remember.

construct cognition:
like vision, we first remember the blur image, like painting.
we first recognize, in simple objects, some pixels are moving together.
for complex objects, the blur image is still moves together,
but some detail will be different.
so we understand, the difference between blur image and its detail.
so, we always remember the blur image first.
only if the detail is too impressive or the whole object hasn't been seen
or the detail is much clear than the shape, the blur image.
(the clear here means the easy level to remove background.)



the smart is base on forget.


dynamic vision:
when we see things, we store the picture in the hbase.
and when the next picture comes, we store,
and make substract with previous version.
alert consciousness, warning level depends on the result.
