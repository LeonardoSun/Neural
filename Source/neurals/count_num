we learn the image of object
when we see objects, we recognize the object, and send message to upper level cortex.
usually sent to the constant characterization level cortex.
we create the pattern from the object image to one,
and add another object, create pattern from two object to two.
the process of recognize new one is stored as another pattern,
which clustering the patterns that connect object and number.
recognize object is just clustering the the information.
understand or conclude concept, is just clustering the cluster of patterns what we recognize„ÄÅfeel objects.
they just clustering something.
